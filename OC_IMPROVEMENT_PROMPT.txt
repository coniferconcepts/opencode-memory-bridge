@solo-orchestrator I need to improve and optimize our OpenCode global configuration. We just got it working with a resolved/inlined config, but we need to verify everything, clean up, and optimize.

## Current Situation
- OpenCode is working with a 121KB inlined configuration (24 agents)
- All prompt files were converted to JSON-safe format with escaped characters
- There are backup files (.backup, .original) in the prompts directory that need cleanup
- The original config with {file:...} references had JSON escaping issues
- We need to verify everything works and optimize the setup

## Your Task

Execute the improvement plan in phases:

### Phase 1: VERIFY THE SETUP
1. Test that OpenCode loads all 24 agents:
   - List all agents in the config
   - Verify each agent is accessible
   - Check agent counts match expected (25 total including router)

2. Test key functionality:
   - Test @tool-utility can read files
   - Test @planner can create a simple plan
   - Test @router (if available) or verify routing metadata exists
   - Test a specialist agent like @legend-state-expert

3. Verify Context7 MCP:
   - Check if Context7 integration is working
   - Test the @context7-super-expert if available

### Phase 2: CLEANUP
Clean up all temporary and backup files:

1. Remove backup files from prompts directory:
   ```bash
   find ~/.opencode/universal/prompts -name "*.backup" -delete
   find ~/.opencode/universal/prompts -name "*.original" -delete
   ```

2. List what backup directories exist in ~/.config/ and clean up old ones (keep the most recent if needed)

3. Verify no unnecessary files remain in the prompts directory

### Phase 3: OPTIMIZATION
Test if we can re-enable file references:

1. Create a test: Try using {file:...} references with the properly escaped files
2. If it works, we can convert back to file references to reduce config size
3. If not, keep the inlined version and optimize it:
   - Check for duplicate content across agents
   - See if we can reduce the 121KB size
   - Ensure all content is necessary

### Phase 4: DOCUMENTATION
Update documentation:

1. Create a summary of what was fixed:
   - The JSON escaping issue with file references
   - The solution (inlining prompts)
   - Current working state

2. Update README if needed with:
   - Final file structure
   - How the configuration works
   - Any known limitations

3. Document the cleanup performed

## Expected Outcomes

After your work, we should have:
- ✅ Verified working configuration with all 24 agents
- ✅ Clean prompts directory (no .backup/.original files)
- ✅ Optimized config (either with working file references or efficient inlined version)
- ✅ Updated documentation
- ✅ Confirmation everything works

## Important Notes

- The config file is at: ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
- The prompts are at: ~/.opencode/universal/prompts/
- The symlink points: ~/.opencode -> ~/CODE/opencode-global-config
- Keep backups of critical files before making changes
- Test each change to ensure OpenCode still works

## Deliverables

Provide a comprehensive report including:
1. Which agents were tested and their status
2. What cleanup was performed
3. Whether file references work or not
4. Final config size and optimization results
5. Any issues found and how they were resolved

Start with Phase 1 verification, then proceed through each phase systematically.
